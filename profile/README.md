## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to Koishi!

### What is Koishi?
Koishi is a platform for data collection and visualizatino. 

The Koishi GitHub organization is a place where you can find repositories for each of Koishi's components.

### Getting started
_Follow one of the great 5mins tutorials on the [Koishi documentation](https://www.notion.so/hendrychjan/Koishi-docs-706dfe04d2d34861a8316af7bd26ceb9) to get started ASAP._

Koishi consists of 3 main components: [web app](https://github.com/koishi-space/koishi), [REST API](https://github.com/koishi-space/koishi-api)
and an [Android app](https://github.com/koishi-space/koishi-mobile). All of these components are open-source and free to use.

To get started, register on the official Koishi servers at [koishi.nechapu.to](https://koishi.nechapu.to), or install Koishi on-premise.
